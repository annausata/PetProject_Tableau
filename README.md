## Pet Project: Tableau Sales Analysis

**I created this project to practice data visualization in Tableau using real-world sales data.**

For this project, I used a dataset from Kaggle to build an interactive Tableau dashboard that provides insights into sales and profit trends. The visualization includes:

1. **Heatmap** – Displays the geographical distribution of sales across different cities, highlighting regions with the highest and lowest sales activity.
2. **Box plot** – Analyzes the variability of monthly sales volume, showing seasonal patterns and identifying months with unusually high or low sales.
3. **Bar chart** – Breaks down sales and profit by product sub-category, revealing the most profitable categories (e.g., Phones, Copiers) and those generating losses (e.g., Tables).

This analysis helps identify top-performing products, detect potential problem areas, and understand sales trends across different time periods and locations.
